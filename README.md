# Mag-6-Plus-Earthquakes-Data-Visualization-through-Power-BI
This project contains the visualization done on the past Earthquakes records through Power BI.

Data set contains the following features -
* Timezone when earthquake occurs.
* Latitude & Longitude coordinates of the earthquake.
* Depth - It shows how much deep inside the earth crust the earthquake started.
* Mag - Magnitude of the earthquake.
* Mag Type - mb, mj, ms, Mt, Mw, mwb, mwc, mwp, mwr, mww, uk
* Nst - Number of seismic stations which reported P- and S-arrival times for this earthquake.
P waves travel fastest and are the first to arrive from the earthquake. In S or shear waves, rock oscillates perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
* Gap - In seismology, the term "gap" refers to a section of a fault that has not experienced a large earthquake in a significant amount of time. It is believed that seismic energy accumulates in these areas, making them more prone to experience a large earthquake in the future.
* dmin - Refers to the minimum distance between a seismic station and the epicenter of an earthquake. The term "dmin" is derived from "minimum distance."
* rms - stands for root mean square, which is a mathematical method used to measure the amplitude of seismic waves.
* net - A seismic network is a collection of seismometers and other seismic monitoring instruments that are used to detect and record earthquakes in a particular region.
* place - Location of earthquake

With the help data we have created an interactive dashboard which shows the insights of the data.

* In this dashboard we can filter the data based on Magnitude and Year of occurance of earthquake, also we can filter the visualization based of mag type. 
* We have plotted the earthquake locations on a world map which shows the average magnitude of earthquake in those locations.
* Dashboard also shows the average magnitude and average depth of the earthquake based of the filters we apply.
* A pie chart has been plotted which shows the count of the top 5 magnitude type.
* Also there is plot which shows how the count of earthquake have increased over the years.

These are the few visualozation we did on the dataset.
